# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing global COVID-19 data to understand the impact across different continents and countries.  
Using **SQL** , I performed data cleaning and transformation to extract valuable insights from raw data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across countries.
- Identify the continents with the highest infection and death rates.
- Visualize trends over time for better understanding of COVID-19 spread.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** – Data exploration and queries  
- **Excel** – Initial data cleaning

## 🧠 Key SQL Techniques Used
- `JOIN` operations to combine tables (cases, deaths, vaccinations)  
- `CTE` for temporary data transformation  
- `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` (e.g., `SUM() OVER()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`)  
- `CASE WHEN` statements for conditional logic  
- Data filtering and aggregation using `GROUP BY`
